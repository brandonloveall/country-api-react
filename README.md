<h1>Welcome to my project! Here's a quick FAQ:</h1>
<br>
<h3>How did you get the idea to make this?</h3>
<p>The idea came from <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca">this website.</a> Only assistance provided was images of the site in order to give an idea of what it should look like. The styling, with the code being completely original, was eyeballed off those images.</p>
<br>
<h3>So what can it do?</h3>
<p>The site is able to pull information from the REST countries API, display some information on the country in a list, then display more information when clicked. Users can apply filters to trim down the country they are looking for.</p>
<br>
<h3>Are there any deviations from the template?</h3>
<p>A few, namely being:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Country flags keep their original aspect ratios instead of being stretched to fit (looking at youm Nepal and Switzerland)</li>
    <li>The description text is a different color/font weight. Unsure why the weight/color they used for them was not described in the style guide, so I went with 300 weight and white color.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>And what did you learn/would do better next time?</h3>
<p>Quite a lot! Learning what units to use and where was tricky to get the hang of, but using EM and REM is definitely something I'd do better next time rather than pixels. EM and REM help with accessibility by scaling to the users font size, which is a necessary part of web development. Definitely will be using them more often in my other projects.</p>
